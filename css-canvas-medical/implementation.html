            <div class="calculate-ol-div-style">
              You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that we far outperform other vendors
              and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to make
              this determination one way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you
              to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk about their experience.

            <div class="calculate-ol-div-style">
              Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community resources. At a minimum, this means
              porting over your fax number, enrolling your payers with our cleaninghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running.
              We'll also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and closing
              loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or other information technology venders
              are important, we will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

          <li class="li-custom"><span>Data Migration</span>
            <div class="calculate-ol-div-style">
              The first thing we will do is gain access to a fill backup of your current data, which we have executed successfully
              with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics
              and information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes
              and documents is more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

          <li class="li-custom"><span>Training and Site Visit</span>
            <div class="calculate-ol-div-style">
              We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings
              will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and
              billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with
              you on implementation and training.

          <li class="li-custom"><span>Go-Live and Tuning</span>
            <div class="calculate-ol-div-style">
              Go-Live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be with you, either in-person or remotely
              depending on your preference, to make sure everthing goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a handful
              of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying practice management
              settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.

          <li class="li-custom"><span>Sustained Performance</span>
            <div class="calculate-ol-div-style">
              All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide support over the long term. Our Preformance Warranty
              means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all playments back. (We do not expect this to happen)
              . For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7
              support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership for us both.
